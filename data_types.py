# Numeric

'''
Integers =
    This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fractions or decimals). In Python, there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.
Float =
    This value is represented by the float class. It is a real number with a floating-point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.
Complex Numbers =
    A complex number is represented by a complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example = 2+3j

# note: type() function is use define the data type
x = 10
print(type(x))

a = ("Geeks", "for", "Geeks")
b = ["Geeks", "for", "Geeks"]
c = {"Geeks": 1, "for":2, "Geeks":3}
d = "Hello World"
e = 10.23
f = 11.22
 
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))

# Sequence Type

'''
The sequence Data Type in Python is the ordered collection of similar or different Python data types. Sequences allow storing of multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. There are several sequence data types of Python:

Python String
Python List
Python Tuple


String Data Type

    Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote, or triple-quote. In Python, there is no character data type Python, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class. 

    Creating String
    Strings in Python can be created using single quotes, double quotes, or even triple quotes.

List Data Type
    Lists are just like arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.  

    Creating a List in Python
    Lists in Python can be created by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets[].
