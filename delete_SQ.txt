Deleting Data
To delete data from a database table, you can use the SQL DELETE statement. Here's the general syntax:
sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

The WHERE clause specifies the condition for selecting the rows to be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all rows in the table will be deleted.
Deleting a Single Row
To delete a single row, you can use the following syntax:
sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 123;

This will delete the row where the employee_id is 123.
Deleting Multiple Rows
To delete multiple rows based on a condition, you can use the following syntax:
sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';

This will delete all rows where the department is 'Sales'.
Conditional Deletes
You can use the WHERE clause to delete rows based on specific conditions. This allows you to selectively remove data from your table.
Deleting Rows Based on a Condition
For example, to delete all employees who have a salary less than 50,000:
sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE salary < 50000;

This will delete all rows where the salary is less than 50,000.
Deleting Rows Based on Multiple Conditions
You can also use multiple conditions in the WHERE clause, connected by AND or OR operators:
sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales' AND years_of_experience < 5;

This will delete the rows where the department is 'Sales' and the years_of_experience is less than 5.
