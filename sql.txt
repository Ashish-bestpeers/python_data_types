Relational Database Management Systems, ACID Properties, Normalization
Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) use tables to store data in a structured format. ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensure reliable transactions. Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy.
